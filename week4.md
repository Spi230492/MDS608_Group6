## Task 1
Here’s a breakdown of the best business structures for each situation:
1. ## Web Developer with a Day Job:
 ## Recommended Business Structure: Sole Trader
   - **Reason**: The web developer works on personal projects in their free time and charges clients on an hourly basis. Since they are operating independently, have no partners, and are likely working on a small scale, the simplest structure is a sole trader. This structure is easy to set up, requires minimal paperwork, and is tax-efficient for small businesses. It also provides the flexibility of managing clients and revenue without the need for complex legal structures.

2. ## Two Data Science Graduates Collaborating:
## Recommended Business Structure: Partnership
   - **Reason**: Since the two data scientists are collaborating and have distinct areas of responsibility (designing dashboards and handling machine learning), a partnership would be a suitable option. In a partnership, both individuals can share responsibilities, profits, and liabilities. This structure allows for better sharing of resources and expertise, while still being relatively simple and flexible. The partnership allows for decision-making to be done jointly, and the tax liabilities are shared as well.

3. ## Data Science Graduate with an App Idea and Investor:
 ## Recommended Business Structure: Company (Limited Liability Company - LLC)
   - **Reason**: The data science graduate is working on an app with plans to secure investment and involve an investor as a partner. In this case, forming a company (specifically a Limited Liability Company, LLC) is the best option. This structure protects the founder’s personal assets by separating them from the business, which is important when dealing with investors. A company structure also helps to formalize business operations, make the app more attractive to investors, and ensure clear terms for ownership and control. It is a more complex structure, but it is well-suited for scaling and external investment.

These business structures balance ease of operation, liability concerns, and future growth potential.
