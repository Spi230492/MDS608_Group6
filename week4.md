## Task 1
Here’s a breakdown of the best business structures for each situation:
1. ## Web Developer with a Day Job:
 ## Recommended Business Structure: Sole Trader
   - **Reason**: The web developer works on personal projects in their free time and charges clients on an hourly basis. Since they are operating independently, have no partners, and are likely working on a small scale, the simplest structure is a sole trader. This structure is easy to set up, requires minimal paperwork, and is tax-efficient for small businesses. It also provides the flexibility of managing clients and revenue without the need for complex legal structures.

2. ## Two Data Science Graduates Collaborating:
## Recommended Business Structure: Partnership
   - **Reason**: Since the two data scientists are collaborating and have distinct areas of responsibility (designing dashboards and handling machine learning), a partnership would be a suitable option. In a partnership, both individuals can share responsibilities, profits, and liabilities. This structure allows for better sharing of resources and expertise, while still being relatively simple and flexible. The partnership allows for decision-making to be done jointly, and the tax liabilities are shared as well.

3. ## Data Science Graduate with an App Idea and Investor:
 ## Recommended Business Structure: Company (Limited Liability Company - LLC)
   - **Reason**: The data science graduate is working on an app with plans to secure investment and involve an investor as a partner. In this case, forming a company (specifically a Limited Liability Company, LLC) is the best option. This structure protects the founder’s personal assets by separating them from the business, which is important when dealing with investors. A company structure also helps to formalize business operations, make the app more attractive to investors, and ensure clear terms for ownership and control. It is a more complex structure, but it is well-suited for scaling and external investment.

These business structures balance ease of operation, liability concerns, and future growth potential.




TASK 2

 A big tech company is planning to acquire a small startup to integrate their new solution into the company’s web services.
The board of director are responsible for acquiring another company is a strategic decision. This decision impacts the direction of the company and requires attention, including financial considerations, long-term goals, risk management. Thus, the board member must approve major acquisitions, as they affect the company’s structure, finances, and market position. The executive team would execute the acquisition and handle integration, but the board’s approval is needed first.
A company has two data science teams working in two different time zones. Merging the teams would be more efficient for the business.
This is an operational decision focused on improving business efficiency. The executive team, led by the CEO, is responsible for managing the company’s day-to-day activities, such as streamlining processes and improving operational effectiveness. 
An investigation in a company has revealed serious misconduct by one member of the board. That member needs to be replaced.
This situation directly involves the governance of the company. The Board of Director are responsible for maintaining ethical standards and ensuring the integrity of the governance structure. Thus, if a board member is involved in any kind of misconduct, the board itself must take appropriate action, which may include investigating the issue, and also removing the board member.
