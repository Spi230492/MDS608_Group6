## TASK3
Here's a structured solution to evaluate and prioritize each task based on the provided framework:

### 1. Build a new complex anomaly detection model
- Influence on business: High  
  - Could significantly reduce customer support costs by catching trends early.  
- Chance of pulling off: Low  
Anomaly detection models for minute signals are often noisy and challenging to make reliable.  
  Data science team joy: High  
  - Building complex models is engaging and challenging for data scientists.  

## Summary:  
- This project has a high potential business impact and is exciting for the team, but its low feasibility due to the technical complexity makes it a risky choice.  

### 2. Automate a manual report into a dashboard
- Influence on business: Low  
  - The primary value is saving employee time, as the report already exists.  
- Chance of pulling off: High  
  - With existing data, the project has a low risk of failure.  
- ## Data science team joy: Low  
  - It involves redoing existing work and has a maintenance burden.  
## Summary:  
- This project is easy to execute and offers some operational efficiency gains, but it has low strategic impact and may not excite the team.

### 3. Add natural language processing (NLP) to categorize customer input
- Influence on business: Medium  
  - Categorizing input is helpful, though not transformative to the product.  
- Chance of pulling off**: Medium  
  - Success depends on effectively defining relevant categories.  
- **Data science team joy: Medium  
  - The project is moderately interesting and involves developing new models.  

## Summary:  
- This project has a moderate impact on the business, is feasible, and provides some level of interest for the team, making it a balanced choice.  

### Recommendation:
Prioritize tasks based on organizational goals and resource allocation:  
1. If the goal is innovation and long-term strategic impact**, invest in the **complex anomaly detection model, despite its risks.  
2. If the focus is on immediate operational efficiency and low risk**, prioritize the **report automation into a dashboard.  
3. If the aim is a balanced approach with moderate risk and reward**, go with **adding NLP for customer input categorization.  

This approach ensures alignment between business impact, feasibility, and team motivation.
