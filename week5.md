## TASK3
Here's a structured solution to evaluate and prioritize each task based on the provided framework:

### 1. Build a new complex anomaly detection model
- Influence on business: High  
  - Could significantly reduce customer support costs by catching trends early.  
- Chance of pulling off: Low  
Anomaly detection models for minute signals are often noisy and challenging to make reliable.  
  Data science team joy: High  
  - Building complex models is engaging and challenging for data scientists.  

## Summary:  
- This project has a high potential business impact and is exciting for the team, but its low feasibility due to the technical complexity makes it a risky choice.  

### 2. Automate a manual report into a dashboard
- Influence on business: Low  
  - The primary value is saving employee time, as the report already exists.  
- Chance of pulling off: High  
  - With existing data, the project has a low risk of failure.  
- ## Data science team joy: Low  
  - It involves redoing existing work and has a maintenance burden.  
## Summary:  
- This project is easy to execute and offers some operational efficiency gains, but it has low strategic impact and may not excite the team.

### 3. Add natural language processing (NLP) to categorize customer input
- Influence on business: Medium  
  - Categorizing input is helpful, though not transformative to the product.  
- Chance of pulling off**: Medium  
  - Success depends on effectively defining relevant categories.  
- **Data science team joy: Medium  
  - The project is moderately interesting and involves developing new models.  

## Summary:  
- This project has a moderate impact on the business, is feasible, and provides some level of interest for the team, making it a balanced choice.  

### Recommendation:
Prioritize tasks based on organizational goals and resource allocation:  
1. If the goal is innovation and long-term strategic impact**, invest in the **complex anomaly detection model, despite its risks.  
2. If the focus is on immediate operational efficiency and low risk**, prioritize the **report automation into a dashboard.  
3. If the aim is a balanced approach with moderate risk and reward**, go with **adding NLP for customer input categorization.  

This approach ensures alignment between business impact, feasibility, and team motivation.




TASK 4

1. Data scientists are given laptops and can use whatever tool set and programming language they want if they finish the assigned work well.
From a Data Scientist's Perspective:
Pros:
Flexibility and autonomy: Data scientists get to choose the tools that work best for them, which makes them more comfortable and potentially more productive.
Innovation and experimentation: Having the freedom to experiment with new tools can lead to creative and innovative solutions.
Cons:
Fragmentation and inconsistency: With everyone using different tools, the team’s codebase could end up being a mix of languages, making it hard to integrate everything smoothly.
Onboarding challenges: New team members could have trouble getting up to speed with a codebase that's spread across multiple languages and tools.
From a Business Perspective:
Pros:
Potential for faster work: If each data scientist is using the tools they’re most comfortable with, they might get tasks done quicker in the short term.
Cons:
Increased costs: Supporting a wide variety of tools and languages can be expensive. It may require more training and resources to keep everything running smoothly.
2. Data scientists are allowed to use the programming language and library they want on their laptops but are encouraged to use tools that align with the existing cloud platform whenever possible.
From a Data Scientist's Perspective:
Pros:
Guided flexibility: You can still use the tools you prefer, but there’s some direction to make sure your choices align with the cloud platform. This reduces potential integration issues.
Better cloud integration: If you follow the cloud platform guidelines, it makes it easier to deploy models and share data, streamlining collaboration.
Cons:
Inconsistencies may remain: Despite the encouragement to align with the cloud platform, some data scientists might still use tools that don’t fully fit with it, leading to inefficiencies.
Potential friction: Some team members might feel that the push to use certain tools is too restrictive, limiting their autonomy and creative freedom.
From a Business Perspective:
Pros:
Cost savings: Encouraging alignment with the existing cloud platform can help reduce unnecessary costs by making the infrastructure easier to maintain and scale.
Fewer deployment issues: Aligning with the cloud platform ensures better compatibility, reducing deployment challenges.
Cons:
Limits on innovation: Encouraging alignment with the cloud platform might unintentionally hold back new ideas or innovations if certain cloud tools don’t fit specific tasks.
Increased complexity: Managing a mix of languages and tools, even if aligned with the cloud, can still create complexities that slow down the process and increase maintenance.
3. Data scientists are required to use cloud infrastructure, Python, and a specific set of ML libraries. Other tools can be used, but they need approval from the technical lead.
From a Data Scientist's Perspective:
Pros:
Standardized environment: Having clear guidelines on what tools to use reduces confusion and helps data scientists focus on their work. It also makes collaboration easier.
Easier deployment and maintenance: A consistent setup means it’s simpler to deploy models and maintain projects across the team.
Cons:
Less freedom: Data scientists may feel restricted by the mandatory use of Python and specific libraries, especially if they think other tools would be better for certain tasks.
Approval delays: The need for approval to use other tools can slow things down, especially if the approval process is slow or cumbersome.
From a Business Perspective:
Pros:
Consistency and scalability: A standardized infrastructure makes it easier to manage the team and projects. It’s simpler to scale, onboard new members, and maintain a consistent codebase.
Better cost management: A standardized approach allows the business to optimize its resources and control costs more effectively.
Cons:
Resistance to change: Some data scientists may not like the constraints and might be less motivated if they feel their creativity is stifled.
Innovation limits: Restricting the team to Python and specific libraries could prevent them from exploring new, more suitable tools, potentially slowing down innovation.
4. Data scientists must only use exactly the tool set allowed by the technical leader, the manager, and DevOps.
From a Data Scientist's Perspective:
Pros:
Clear guidelines: Data scientists know exactly which tools to use, which reduces ambiguity and makes collaboration easier since everyone’s on the same page.
Better collaboration: Since everyone is using the same tools, team members can easily contribute to each other’s projects and keep the codebase consistent.
Cons:
Stifled flexibility: Data scientists might feel frustrated if they’re forced to use tools that don’t fit the specific needs of their task. For example, R might be better for statistical analysis, but they’re required to use Python.
Potential burnout: Constantly using tools that aren’t ideal for certain tasks might lead to frustration, exhaustion, or even burnout over time.
From a Business Perspective:
Pros:
Lower overhead: Using a single set of tools reduces the need for training and support, leading to lower operational costs.
Smoother deployment and maintenance: A consistent toolset ensures deployment is streamlined and reduces integration problems.
Cons:
Limits on innovation: By restricting the team to a narrow set of tools, the business might miss out on better technologies or approaches that could be more efficient for certain tasks.
Morale issues: If data scientists feel restricted and forced to work with tools they dislike or that don’t suit the task, it could lead to dissatisfaction and higher turnover.
