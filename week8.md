Task 4
1.	Consider Whether to Collect Personal Information
You need to decide whether you want to collect personal information from users. In this case, you’re only collecting the customer's name and email address to create an account. You don’t need to collect extra information like the customer’s location or face image.
Important contract clauses:
Data Collection Clause: Clearly state that you will only collect necessary information like the user's name and email. No additional data will be collected unless required later.
Example: The company will only collect personal data that is essential for creating an account—specifically the user's name and email address. No other personal data, such as location or images, will be collected.

2. Privacy by Design

The personal data must be stored safely, and access should only be given to authorized people. If anyone changes the data, you need to log who made the change and why, so there’s a record of any modifications.
Important contract clauses:
Data Security Clause: The personal data should be kept in a secure place, and only people who are authorized should have access to it.
Example: All personal data will be stored securely with limited access. Only authorized personnel will be allowed to view or modify the data.
Change Log Clause: Any change to personal data must be logged with the name of the person making the change and the reason for it.
Example: All changes made to personal data will be logged, including the name of the person making the change and the reason for it.

3. Assessing the Risks
You need to make sure the data is secure and can’t be accessed by unauthorized people. You also need to check if the hardware (computers, servers, etc.) where the data is stored is in good shape and safe.
Important contract clauses:
Risk Assessment Clause: Regular checks should be done to make sure the data is secure, and only authorized people can access it.
Example: The company will conduct regular assessments to ensure the security of personal data and verify that only authorized users can access it.

Hardware Health Clause: Ensure that the equipment storing the data is regularly checked to ensure it remains secure.
Example: The company will monitor the health of all hardware used to store or process personal data to ensure it remains secure.

4. Putting Strategies to Protect Personal Information
Make sure everyone who has access to personal data uses secure methods to log in, like two-factor authentication (2FA) and strong passwords. Also, have a backup plan in case something goes wrong, so the data can be restored.


Important contract clauses:
Authentication and Access Clause: Require everyone who has access to the data to use secure login methods like 2FA and strong passwords.
Example: All personnel with access to personal data must use two-factor authentication and secure password practices.

Backup and Recovery Clause: Have a backup plan in place so that if anything goes wrong, you can recover and restore the data.
Example: The company will implement a secure data backup strategy and ensure data can be restored in case of loss or damage.

5. Destroy or De-identify Personal Information

When customers decide to opt out of the program, their personal information must be permanently deleted or anonymized (so it can’t be linked to them anymore).
Important contract clauses:
De-identification Clause: Clearly state how the company will remove or anonymize a customer’s personal information when they opt out of the program.
Example: Upon a customer's request to opt out, their personal data will be permanently deleted or anonymized, following our data deletion policy.
