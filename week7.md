Task 4

Case 1: Developing a Large Language Model (LLM) for Customer Care

The company has been approached by a financial institution to create a custom Large Language Model (LLM) that will handle customer support queries.
•	Project Scope: You will develop an AI-based system (LLM) to automatically answer customer support questions for the financial institution.
•	Payment Terms: Payment will be split into three parts: 20% when you deliver the initial design, 40% when you deliver the final design, and the remaining 40% after the solution has been deployed and used for two months.
•	Intellectual Property (IP) Rights: Your company (the developer) will retain the copyrights for the code created.
•	Non-disclosure Agreement (NDA): The financial institution agrees not to share or disclose the code with anyone else.
•	Non-compete Clause: Your team agrees not to work on similar projects for one year after completing this project.
•	Warranties and Liabilities: The LLM will not be responsible for making financial decisions on behalf of the financial institution, limiting your liability.

Important Clauses for the Contract:
1.	Clear Project Scope: Specify exactly what is being developed—an LLM for answering customer queries.
2.	Payment Structure: Break down the payment schedule to ensure fair compensation at each project milestone.
3.	IP Ownership: Outline that your company will retain ownership of the code, but the customer gets a license to use it.
4.	Confidentiality (NDA): Make it clear that the financial institution cannot share or leak any code or proprietary information.
5.	Non-compete Clause: Specific time-period (one year) during which your team cannot take on similar projects.
6.	Warranties and Liabilities: Clearly define that your company will not be liable for any financial decisions made by the system.

Case 2: Developing an App for Insurance Claims
The company has been approached by an insurance company to develop an app for managing insurance claims on iOS and Android.
•	Project Scope: You will build an app for both iOS and Android to receive and manage insurance claims, including a hosting service where users can upload necessary files.
•	Payment Terms: The payment is split into three parts: 20% when you deliver the initial design, 40% when you deliver the final design, and 40% after the solution has been deployed and used for two months.
•	Intellectual Property (IP) Rights: Your company (the developer) will retain the copyrights for the code.
•	Non-disclosure Agreement (NDA): The insurance company must keep your code confidential and not share it with others.
•	Non-compete Clause: Your team agrees not to develop a similar app for a year.
•	Warranties and Liabilities: The responsibility for reviewing insurance claims lies with the insurance representatives. You, as the developer, will provide a retention period of one year for the files uploaded through the app.
Important Clauses for the Contract:
1.	Clear Project Scope: Define the work in detail, including the app for managing insurance claims and the hosting service for uploaded files.
2.	Payment Schedule: Include a payment plan to make sure you’re paid at key stages of the project (initial design, final design, and post-deployment).
3.	IP Ownership: Your company keeps the copyrights of the code, but the insurance company gets a license to use it.
4.	Confidentiality (NDA): Ensure that the insurance company agrees not to share your code with any third parties.
5.	Non-compete Clause: Make it clear that your team cannot develop similar apps for other insurance companies for one year.
6.	Warranties and Liabilities: Clearly state that reviewing insurance claims is the insurance company’s responsibility, and you will only handle the app and file retention.
By addressing these key clauses in the contract, you ensure that both your company and the client have clear expectations, protecting both parties' interests and minimizing risks.


## TASK3 
## 1. Netflix's suggested modification is to raise the costs for smart TVs.
Context: Regardless of the device you're using to watch, Netflix costs the same monthly fee for its three subscription levels (Basic, Standard, and Premium). The idea is to raise the cost of smart TVs, which have larger screens and can accommodate more viewers at once.
Justifications for:
Greater Resource Consumption: Netflix may contend that, in comparison to smaller devices like phones or laptops, it uses more resources (such as bandwidth and server capacity) per user on large displays because smart TVs frequently accommodate numerous viewers at once.
Market segmentation may enable Netflix to modify prices in accordance with the content's perceived worth. Large screen users may be perceived as more likely to consume  content in a group, thus increasing the value of their subscription.
## Reasons Opposed to:
## Customer Backlash: A significant percentage of the clientele may become irate if costs for smart TV customers are raised. People already pay a lot to access Netflix, so this adjustment can be seen as discriminatory or unfair.
Complicated Pricing Structure: Customers may become confused if this adds needless complexity to the pricing plan. Users can become dissatisfied if they have to determine if watching on their phone or TV affects their membership cost.
Competition: Services like Amazon Prime and Disney+ that have more straightforward pricing structures and don't impose additional fees for device use may pose a greater threat to Netflix.
In conclusion, I oppose the suggested modification. Although Netflix may have a basis for increased prices since it uses more resources, the prospective client dissatisfaction and the negative impact on brand loyalty outweigh the financial benefits of this change. Simplified pricing is a better approach, as it enhances customer experience and avoids confusion.
