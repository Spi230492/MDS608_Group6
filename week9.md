Task 4
1. Set up a Phone Hotline for Customers to Report Scams

Create a dedicated phone line where customers can call if they think they've been scammed or are at risk of being scammed. This way, they have a quick and easy way to get help.

This gives customers a direct way to contact the bank for support, allowing the bank to act and guide them through what to do next.

2. Ask Customers to Verify Any Request for Personal Information

Remind customers to always double-check any request for personal information. For example, if someone calls them asking for sensitive details like their account number, they should hang up and call the bank directly to confirm if it’s legitimate.

Scammers often impersonate banks to trick people into giving up sensitive information. Make sure customers know that banks will never ask for personal details over the phone.

3. Encourage Customers to Resist Pressure to Act Quickly

Tell customers that scammers often try to pressure them into acting fast, such as making an immediate payment or transferring money. Encourage them to take their time and think carefully before making any decisions.

Also, scammers want to make people panic and act without thinking. Remind your customers that if something feels rushed or too good to be true, they should stop and ask for advice.

4. Advise Customers to Ask for Alternative Ways to Pay

Let customers know that if someone insists, they only use one specific way to send money (like a gift card or a certain payment app), that’s a red flag. Encourage customers to ask if there are other ways they can pay.

Scammers often only accept payment through certain methods because it’s harder to trace or reverse those payments. If they insist on one way, it's likely a scam.

5. Remind Customers to Report Suspicious Activity in Their Accounts
Ask customers to keep an eye on their bank accounts and immediately report anything suspicious, such as unfamiliar transactions or unexpected changes in their account details.
The quicker a customer reports suspicious activity, the faster the bank can take action to stop fraud and prevent further damage.
