## Task 3 (20mins): 
Continuing Professional Development is a combination of ideas, techniques, and approaches that are designed to help you manage and enhance your growth, abilities and learning as a professional. The field of computer science is changing rapidly, and computer professionals should keep up with recent advancements in the field. 
In groups (4-5 students), on a scale of (high, medium, and low) evaluate each one of the following opportunities for Continuing Professional Development: 
A data scientist trying to learn web development. 
A data scientist trying to switch to machine learning engineer by learning how to code in pytorch. 
A data scientist applying for a masterâ€™s in finance. 

 
A data scientist who is attempting to acquire web programming skills
Medium to low :
Justification: Unless a data scientist intends to work on projects requiring front-end development or full-stack data apps, web development skills might not immediately improve their core competences, even if they can be useful. However, if they wish to display data insights through dashboards or online apps, knowing web programming can be helpful. Compared to other CPD paths, this is less important but has a medium relevance for the advancement of a general data science profession.A data scientist who is attempting to acquire web programming skills

A data scientist attempting to learn PyTorch coding in order to transition to machine learning engineering
High CPD Value:
Justification: For a data scientist interested in deploying and optimizing machine learning models, studying PyTorch and moving into a machine learning engineering career is extremely relevant. One of the best tools for ML engineering and deep learning is PyTorch. It is a top priority because this CPD path would immediately expand on their current knowledge base and result in worthwhile professional progress in the data science and AI domains.

A data scientist pursuing a finance master's degree
CPD Rating:Low
Justification: If a data scientist intends to work in financial data science or FinTech, earning a master's degree in finance could help them increase their understanding of financial systems and quantitative finance. Although this might lead to more specialized job pathways, it's a less straightforward path than technical data science capabilities, so it's only moderately relevant unless they want to work in finance.
