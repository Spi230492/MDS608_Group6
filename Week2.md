From data privacy to safety regulations, decisions made in any field, but particularly in ICT, can have a big societal impact.

## Applying the Code in Real-World Situations: Imagine a scenario where you might face a conflict between personal gain and public interest (e.g., using private data for a project without explicit consent). How would the ACS Code of Professional Conduct help guide your actions in this situation?
Consider a situation where I'm working on a project that might improve product recommendations by using customer data, but users haven't given their express agreement. The ACS Code would advise me to put the public interest ahead of my own or my company's benefit in this situation. In particular, I would have to get users' consent and educate stakeholders about the ethical ramifications in accordance with the idea of the primacy of the public interest. I would bring up the matter with my colleagues, arguing that before exploiting any personal information, openness and user consent are essential. This method guarantees that I'm upholding the Code's provisions on users' rights and privacy protection.
